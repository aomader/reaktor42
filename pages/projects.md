## Projects

Over the last couple of years I started a range of projects. Mostly to fulfil
a specific need, but sometimes just for fun and educational purposes. The used
languages vary from C, Python over Haskell to the common web languages HTML,
CSS and JavaScript.


### Software

#### thetime <span class=version>(v0.2)</span>

A tiny X app to draw the current date and time, described by a [strftime(3)]
valid string, directly onto the root window. A lightweight alternative to
[conky] if you want a dead simple clock.

[strftime(3)]: http://linux.die.net/man/3/strftime
[conky]: http://conky.sourceforge.net/


#### qinfo <span class=version>(v1.0)</span>

A fast ASCII art viewer based on the GTK+ toolkit. Inspired by the
[DAMN NFO Viewer] I created a simple but effective text viewer that
properly renders [ASCII art] that is in the CP437 codepage.

[DAMN NFO Viewer]: http://damn-nfo-viewer.softpedia.com/
[ASCII art]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii_art


#### mysmartctl <span class=version>(v0.0)</span>

More to come
