## Projects

Over the last couple of years I started a range of projects. Mostly to fulfil
a specific need, but sometimes just for fun and educational purposes. The used
languages vary from C, Python over Haskell to the common web languages HTML,
CSS and JavaScript.

### Software

* [lala] - a slick yet powerful MPD web client
* [snps] - a C library to solve 15-puzzle games
* [thetime] - a date and time drawing X11 application
* [qinfo] - a fast and lean GTK+ based ASCII art viewer
* [mysmartctl] - controller and terminal for the mySmartUSB device
* [hakismet] - a Haskell library to use the anti-spam service Akismet
* [python-mpd-twisted] - an MPD client library written in pure Python utilizing Twisted

### Hardware

Expect something huge ... ;)

### Hosting

I still maintain a few sites which I also programmed. Most of them are related
to the event management company of my little sister Lisa.
