Let's try to solve some [Project Euler] problems using Haskell. Its
a good way to stress my math knowledge and Haskell knowledge, but its also a
good way to frequently publish some stuff without writing about complete
nonsense.

TL;DR ... lets start with the [first problem].

### Problem 1

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we
> get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
> 
> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Solution

To be honest a fairly easy question to solve using Haskell without
being in the need to grasp the mathematical background though.

We just use [`sum`] in conjunction with a trivial [list comprehension].

~~~ {.haskell}
euler001 :: Int
euler001 = sum [n | n <- [3..999], n `mod` 3 == 0 || n `mod` 5 == 0]
~~~

Since modulo operations are considered expensive we may use us some Haskell
[range notation] with a bit of thinking to simplify the computation. It's
importantent to subtract the sum of the duplicate multiples once.

~~~ {.haskell}
euler001' :: Int
euler001' = sum [3,6..999] + sum [5,10..999] - sum [15,30..999]
~~~

Well, to see if we can do better in the sense of using less cpu cycles but
a bit more brain power lets start to analyse what we just did.
First of all we rewrite it as a mathematical equation.

$$\sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor\frac{999}{3}\rfloor}3i + \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor
\frac{999}{5}\rfloor}5i - \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor\frac{999}{15}\rfloor}15i$$

Turns out equation is composed of three somewhat equally looking summations
of a [series], lets try to simplify the term.

$$\sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor\frac{999}{3}\rfloor}3 \cdot i =
3 \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor\frac{999}{3}\rfloor}i =
3 \cdot \frac{\lfloor\frac{999}{3}\rfloor(\lfloor\frac{999}{3}\rfloor + 1)}
{2}$$

Or generally speaking..

$$C\cdot\sum_{i=1}^{n}i = C \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$

The final step is to transform this knowledge into a proper Haskell
implementation.

~~~ {.haskell}
euler001'' :: Int
euler001'' = sum' 3 + sum' 5 - sum' 15
  where
    sum' i = let n = 999 `div` i in i * n * (n + 1) `div` 2
~~~

The final implementation has a runtime behavior of $O(1)$ instead of $O(n)$
like our first naive implementation.
